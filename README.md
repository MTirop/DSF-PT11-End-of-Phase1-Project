To focus on analyzing the risks of entering the aviation industry, only the most relevant columns were chosen for the study. Columns that weren’t crucial for risk assessment, like longitudes, latitudes, airport name, Registration number and or less useful categories, were left out to make the analysis simpler. A new Data Frame called Risk_df was created, including only key information such as accident dates, severity, aircraft category, number of fatalities, weather conditions among others. This made it easier to clearly examine the trends and factors affecting aviation risk.
## 1.2.2 Data Visualization
For the data selected for trend and descriptive analysis, various graphs were plotted (Two bar charts and one line graph)
### 1.2.2.0 Total Fatal Injuries against the make.
### 1.2.2.1 Total fatalities against Weather condition.
### 1.2.2.2 Total Fatalities against Event Date


# 1.3 CONCLUSION
* Lowest fatalities were registered with Mooney make.
* Despite Good weather conditions , Highest fatalities was registered.
* The number of fatalities decreased over time for periods between 2012 and 2022.
